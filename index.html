  <h2>About Me:</h2>
  <h4>I am an Oregonian, who has a passion for education, tech, and math. Math has always been my 
  favorite subject in school, especially since this passion has blossomed into me being a math 
  tutor for roughly 10 years. Through helping hundreds of students over time, I started to realize
  I was focussing on the same points for most students. Math is something most American students feel
  disgust for, and I believe that comes from a lack of a well rounded math curriculum. After coming
  to this realization, I found my career path. I knew I wanted to create educational material and
  tools to help students realize their true academic potential. Combining my background in working
  in different educational settings, with my technical skills in Math & Computer Science, I think
  my career will be in the Educational Tech sector. Whether that is to help design curriculum, create
  more intuitive UI/UX design, or design software to create more engaging learning environemnts for
  students, I think working in this field is not only the best fit professioanlly, but is the best fit
  for who I am as a person.</h4>
