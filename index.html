    <h2 class= "about-title">About Me:</h2>
    <div class="about-box">
      I am an Oregonian, who has a passion for education, tech, and math. Math has always been my 
      favorite subject in school, especially since this passion has blossomed into a 10 year tutoring career. 
      Through helping hundreds of students over the years, I started to realize
      I was focussing on the same points for most students. Math is something most American students feel
      disgust for, and I believe that comes from a lack of a well rounded math curriculum. After coming
      to this realization, I found my career path. I knew I wanted to create educational material and
      tools to help students realize their true academic potential. Combining my background in working
      in different educational settings, with my technical skills in Math & Computer Science, my career path
      is headed straight for the Educational Tech sector. Whether that is to help design curriculum, create
      more intuitive UI/UX design, or design software to create more engaging learning environemnts for
      students, I think working in this field is not only the best fit professioanlly, but is the best fit
      for who I am as a person.</h4>
